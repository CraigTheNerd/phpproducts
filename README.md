## About PHP Products

PHP Products is a code assessment I was asked to complete.

This MVC Core branch implements a MVC approach to the project to offer an extensible approach to the code.

Application Demo - https://phpproducts.dicitil.co.za/

##  The PHP Logic

I'm happy with the MVC structure.
Next I'll implement the products logic into the frontend


## The Front End

I first built the PHP logic as what was required for the assessment.
The code is available here and the output can be viewed on the demo url.

I have built a front end but for starters its static.
Next I will make it dynamic with the content from the backend
I will push the code and update the demo as soon as this is implemented.

##  Application Structure

The structure of the application now follows the MVC design pattern

##  Refactors

Code refactors to look at

- Product Logic
- Dynamic Front End
