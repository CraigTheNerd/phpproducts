## About PHP Products

PHP Products is a code assessment I was asked to complete.

This is the initial solution to the two problems I was tasked to complete.

Application Demo - https://phpproducts.dicitil.co.za/

##  The PHP Logic

This is an initial take on the code. Further changes are to come...

## The Front End

I first built the PHP logic as what was required for the assessment.
The code is available here and the output can be viewed on the demo url.

I am currently building the front end and I will push the code and update the demo as the front end is implemented.

##  Application Structure

The structure of the application will be changed as I refactor the code.

##  Refactors

Code refactors to look at

- Extensibility
- Application Structure & Layout
